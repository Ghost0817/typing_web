That's a lot, so this allows you to type quickly, and not worry about accuracy as much.<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">As always, we will be timing you.  From the time you type the first character until you hit the last letter, the timer will be going.  Try to use this to your advantage.  Watch your speed and try to beat that speed on the next exercise.  It's all about timing here!<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">If you make too many mistakes, try again slower.  If you made no mistakes or only a few, try the next exercise faster.<\/p>";
