You may find this lesson challenging, but always remember proper form, keeping your hands on the home row, and to shift with the opposite hand.<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">While typing this lesson, do your best to keep your eyes on the screen and off of your hands.  If you can't remember where a key is, use the onscreen keyboard and hands to help you type it.  Your key to typing fast is remembering where the keys are without looking!<\/p>";
