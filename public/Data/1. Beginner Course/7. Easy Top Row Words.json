You may occasionally run across a word that will trip you up, just to keep you on your toes!<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">Make sure your fingers are on the home row before you type each word.  Refer to the onscreen keyboard and hands if you are unsure as to which finger should press the key.  Try to keep your eyes off your hands as much as possible.  Good luck!<\/p>";
