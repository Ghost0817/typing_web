It is known to allow faster typing because the keys are placed strategically to allow faster finger movement.  QWERTY, on the other hand, was invented to slow a typist down so typewriters would not jam.<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">This is actually quite a long lesson, and covers all there is to learn of Dvorak, so I hope you get something out of it.<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\"><strong>Be sure to click the \"Language & Keyboard\" link above and switch to the Dvorak layout if you want to see the proper on-screen keyboard.  Note: You can type this lesson with any keyboard, but it will just look like random letters. Not too helpful, in that case.<\/strong><\/p>";
