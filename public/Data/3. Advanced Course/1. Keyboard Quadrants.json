We will begin with the top left keys.  Stretch out your left hand, and crack those knuckles if you need to!  Your right hand can relax sometimes, but will still be required.<\/p><p class=\"typing help\">And, being that this is an advanced lesson, you have to maintain at least 94% accuracy... so take your time and concentrate on hitting the right keys.<\/p><p class=\"typinghelp\">Enjoy!<\/p>";
